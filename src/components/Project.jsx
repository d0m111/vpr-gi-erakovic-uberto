            <p>After the premiere of Pure Bloom as part of Opus 201 - Ludwig Van, in august 2021, accordionist Filip ErakoviÄ‡, and composer Francisco Uberto decide to start a new collaboration to create a new original piece of music for solo accordionist and electronics.</p>
            <p>The main goal is to explore the accordion in a dialectic relationship with computer music and pedal effects.
                Synchronization, continuity, loudness, fragility, sustained energy, are the main techniques we have the need to explore inside of a fresh approach of the instrument.</p>
            <p>During our exploratory process, we are going to disassemble the instrument with the aim to experiment with different parts of its mechanism in combination with effect pedals, and digital sound processes.</p>
            <p>Forward-looking for a music with a rude/tender, with animal sensitivity. Approaching a Techno/No-input/ aesthetic balanced with pure and simplified harmonies into an unforeseen musical discourse.</p>
